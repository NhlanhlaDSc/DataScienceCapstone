## IBM Data Science Capstone Project: Space X Rockets

This project was completed in fulfillment of requirements to obtain the "IBM Data Science" specialization course from Coursera. This project is aimed at demonstrating various skillsets obtained during the course hence demonstrating as well to show possibilities of data science application. The notebooks are written in Python which is the most popular language in data science as it is empowered by pandas which is a data analysis library. There are many libraries used during the entire project. The project contains the following Notebooks:


- **Data Collection**: use request API to fetch data from the provided link and return a JSON data object, the object is interacted with using a few lines of code to extract the Data Frame from it.

- **Web Scrapping**  : use Beautiful soup library to perform the extraction of tabular data from Wikipedia

- **Data Wrangling** :  this notebook ensures that the data to be used is free of missing values and potential outliers, as missing values are filled with average in this case.

- **EDA with matplotlib** : Visualizes data so that proper modeling decisions can be taken, it uses various types of viz to communicate patterns in the data set.

- **EDA with SQL**: Performing EDA by writing most used queries to fetch data in Data science projects (SQL is fetching data from IBM DB2 cloud database).

- **Predictive Analysis**: Using Machine Learning models to a Classification problem in order to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Folium Maps Viz**: this notebook visualizes the geolocation of launch sites and all information related to launches whether rocket landing was a success or failure.

These are part of various skills used in data science, these were completed on an online Python Documentation corresponding to the specific Python Library used. Enjoy... 

Thank You.
